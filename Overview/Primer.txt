The collapse of the system-spanning empire is beginning to fade from memory, and the world of Avion is finally taking its first steps of progress after a century of survival.

Crater City, the ancient capital of the planet, is feeling the effects from years of institutional rot and corruption. Once the foremost power in the world, it is now being threatened by its former vassals. 

In the north and west, the Frontier Pact, a confederation of cities looking to surmount Crater City and reform the system of the original founding Pioneers, has seen great successes in the recent war, pushing the forces of the ancient capital to the defenses of the Rim. 

In the south, unrest is threatening to lead to rebellion as Crater City struggles to reign in its holdings, threatening the security of the Rim as the Pact recoups and prepares for the end of the cease fire.

And among all of this, there are rumors of someone who seeks to collect all of the old AI caretakers. This Curator presents a threat to the ever influential Stellar Church. 

The ideals of the ancient Pioneers and the old Empire are primed to clash, with Avion as its battleground. The sun is rising, but nobody knows what color it will be.
