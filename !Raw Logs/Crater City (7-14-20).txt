So, Crater City is one of the major city states on Avion, the oldest city in the world, and the former capital of the planet prior to the Collapse. Because of this, a lot of its governing structures trace back to centuries of accumulation, reform, and evolution from the Frontier Era, through the Imperial Era, and now post-Collapse. Overall, the system combines the religious and legal governments together into a theodemocratic system comprised of three organs.

At the highest levels are the most powerful organs: the ancient AI Overseer, and the equally as ancient holy position of Governor. These two often opposed one another, as one is a materialist advising AI looking to manage the city according to its directives, and the other is a religious leader who is attempting to benefit their clique or reshape the city in the ways they imagine. As the Overseer's influence has waned, the Governor's has grown, leaving the AI desperately trying to find a way to bring back order and prosperity to the city.

The other organ is the Grand Council, which is made up of representatives elected by each electoral district. Each is elected to one of 6 committee seats, including defense, foreign relations, economics, justice, finance, and culture. The council is often at odds with both the Overseer and Governor, but is usually divided into a variety of competing parties with their own goals. There are some good people trying to do good work, but they often have to justify shady means to accomplish their goals, furthering the broken system.

This is not a perfect government. In fact, much of its checks and balances as originally conceived by the Pioneers have rotted away. It's filled with corrupt politicians looking to line their own pockets, and populistic leaders looking to seize power over their constituents. Bribery, extortion, and even assassination has become normalized as Crater City collapses in on itself.
