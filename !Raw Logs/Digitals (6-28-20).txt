I envision these digitized dead as living in a sort of purgatory after the collapse. They are the oldest "people" in the world at this point, some hundreds of years old. Society is unrecognizable to them, and for many their components are breaking down from age. So they sort of wander the world, maybe eventually finding a place to settle down where there's a mechanist to help keep their parts repaired, or find others like them and form communities. 

Death is complex, since even if their body breaks down or their power runs out, they still exist in their data cores. Even if that is damaged, redundancies may not mean they die. Some may even have backups stored in the surviving brainvaults. There's a sense of impermanence there, where dying may not mean much if they just end up revived in a new body.

But, there's also an optimism. They remember the old world, so the emerging renaissance is like a beacon of the future. Many might want to be a part of that, and seek to teach about the old ways. While they can't rebuild the world they knew, they can help create a new one.

So in a way they're undead but not feral or evil. They're more of a living memory of the past.

Spicy. So they're Whole Brain Emulations. What sort of bodies are they in?

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Various bodies. Mostly humanoid robots, but some may be in other forms, like canids or avians. You might even get some in curator tablets (think something the size of a large phone, but made out of a fabric-like material that can display images), though that's rare. Their person exists on a data core, so they could be moved from body to body. The core doesn't work on its own, though, so they have to be in something to be conscious.

Can multiple of them be inhabiting the same thing?

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Depends on the thing. There's vaults filled with hundreds of data cores that are entire emulated communities. But the resources required for one core to be processed would prohibit, say, two conscious digitals in one humanoid, for example. Plus, it's not like you would have wanted to share a body with someone else back when the shells were being manufactured, so there's probably very few examples of shells being made for multiple digitals to occupy it

Very nice. So where do these things come from? Ozy your guys are whole brain emulations, so clearly they come from some advanced civilization of sorts.

During the late Imperial Age, the technology for brain digitization was developed. So most digitals are either dead people or transhumanists who were eligible for digitization. It would be common enough to be something everyone has heard about, but most people wouldn't be eligible because either they had some form of brain degradation/damage, a desire to not be digitized at death, or for one reason or another their brains just weren't compatible with the systems.

It wasn't really a factor of wealth, since the Imperial Digital Evolution Act would pay for any expenses. Anatomy was a huge factor, and the technology hadn't progressed enough to get over that hurdle by the time of the collapse, so the digitals that survived are the lucky ones.

The process of digitization does require you to be dead, so all of the digitals are, in some way, dead. Some just weren't dead when they started the process
