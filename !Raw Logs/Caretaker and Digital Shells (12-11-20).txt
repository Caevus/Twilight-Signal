I've been toying with how the Caretaker AI's that once managed Avion would exist in the world. Things like tablets, little bots, etc.

I've already established this idea that consciousness can exist in modules that plug in to an empty body. So, if you have the Caretaker's module, like a small card or core or something, and put it into a mechanical bird body, that is a great way to make the Caretaker mobile and, if the body isn't too conspicuous, hide in plain sight.

Aha, yeah, that works. Plug and play peripherals, just, really really advanced ones.

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Right, exactly

I imagine a Caretaker has a lot of drivers then
but that can be arranged

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Well, most general purpose mechanical bodies were built by one of 2 companies, using fairly standardized systems
So if you find a Vanguard designed body for a Vanguard core, it should work pretty well.

Makes sense to me
and I mean, you could probably write a driver, too?
so I’ll buy this.

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Right, yeah. And the programmers of the Post Collapse would definitely be trying to get components to work together
So even if there's some incompatibility, you're bound to find someone in the cities who has some solution for that

----
Yeah, for sure

I think that opens up a ton of interesting stuff, too. Like, whole communities of Digitals living in these animal shells.
Is that bird you keep seeing around town a curious animal, or a watchful Digital?

I gotta step out, but I like the idea, especially since maybe their habits, missions, or life cycles take them through all kinds of technologies
perhaps there’s a traditional migration every year to SCADA systems, lol
to facilitate building in some tweaks to city technology...

Ozyfestivus [Twilight Signal]
Yeah! And I think there is some limitation there, because the shells do have to have enough room to process the cores. With the exception of the Caretakers, I'd think the cores are pretty much just storage devices, so Digitals aren't really "conscious" when they're unplugged. So a smaller shell might result in a slightly inferior experience to a larger shell.

----
Yeah!
No that’s really cool... they’re like kami.
