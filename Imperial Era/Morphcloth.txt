Morphicloth is a type of Pre-Collapse material used as an interface for many ancient technologies. 

It appears as an extremely smooth cloth or rubber, but can display objects, text, color, and other information in a perceived 3 dimensional "stretching out" of the surface. 

Examples include the AI Curators, The Overseer, and data interfaces for Cyberstasis Chambers.
